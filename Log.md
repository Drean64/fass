# To do

- Add keywords `bit7` & `bit6`?. See [ref](##2022-8-5)
- Add `>` and `<` operators for getting the high and low bytes of a label reference, respectively, as an immediate value
- Integrate with Cpu6502 and make automated VM tests

Added forward reference info in the labels Hash, but there can be many forward references to the same label, so we have to record them separately.

Al pedo el SymbolPass porque también se pueden definir labels con forward references, además para saber la dirección de un label: hay que parsear todo el código :'(
Mejor volver a la idea original, hacer una sola pasada, dejar el espacio y luego cuando se define la forward reference ir y completarlo.

We have a problem. Assembler distinguishes immediate values from addresses with the # sign.
We don't want that verbosity in FASS, that's why names are treated equally, when possible, whether they are a constant or a label.
So, instead of having both constants and direct label addressing defined as IDENFTIFIER, they'll be both integrated into a single rule called `name`, to prevent ambiguity for Antlr.
Then we determine if the name refers to a constant or a label.

We also need to implement a way to use the individual bytes of a label's address as literals, like assembler does with < and >.

Implemented goto (JMP)

I implemented an `if else` fully functional, even nestable. Great achievement!

## 2022-10-1

Well, I forked a try to use visitors and the Dart language, let's see how this goes.
Update: both seem like a very good idea.

## 2022-8-20

Started implementing automated tests.
Removed the grammar that was unimplemented, now I will add it as I go.

## 2022-8-15

Just found out `const` is failing and don't know when it started failing.
Should add unit tests for regression testing, so by running all tests on every commit I can spot regression errors easily.

## 2022-8-5

Should add the keywords `bit7` & `bit6`.
In assembly you would check for these bits using `BVC`, `BVS`, `BPL` & `BMI`, most likely after `BIT` & `CMP`.
To explicitly state that you aren't really checking for sign or overflow as the mnemonics suggest, you would use `if bit7 = 1`, etc.
That way you explicitly state that you are checking for arbitrary bits.
Of course the rest of the bits (0..5) don't have a corresponding CPU flag, so they must be tested with a more classical approach.

## 2022-4-6

const and data are implemented, although some value types are not implemented yet.  
Will implement all value types as they come up in tests or use cases.
